###About
My strong track record working with writers includes 3 years of experience as a freelance editor editing academic writing for publication, as well as 10 years of experience teaching academic writing to 500+ diverse learners (including developing writers and English-language learners). I have excellent written and verbal communication skills, with expertise in both formal and informal presentations; my experience includes 10 years of classroom teaching and multiple professional conference presentations. I am an adaptable, quick, and accurate independent learner with strong project-management and time-management skills: I researched, wrote, revised, edited, and formatted a 300+ page dissertation research project, which was accepted without revisions, while teaching every semester (a total of 32 courses in 10 years). I work well both collaboratively and independently, and thrive in deadline-driven, fast-paced environments. Finally, I have a track record of success in both personnel management and client satisfaction.
